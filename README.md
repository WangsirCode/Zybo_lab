# zybo based lab

some fundamental and interesting lab in [Zybo Zynq-7000](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-4azfte.html) board.

The aim of this labs is to acquaint you with hardware
configuration and programming of the new ARM-based Xilinx Zynq
7010 FPGA using the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. The labs will focus
on the new Xilinx Zybo board, which is surprisingly feature-rich but
extremely compact. It will also serve to acquaint the you with
various features of high-end embedded processors. Finally, the labs
will provide familiarity with the concept of FPGA-based custom
embedded system design, where one or more ARM Cortex-A9 hardware
processor cores are integrated with selected integrated “soft” peripherals
on a single FPGA chip. This relatively new approach to embedded
system design is called “System on a Chip” (SoC) design. This course
will focus on configuring the hardware and also the software of the
Xilinx Zynq 7010 FPGA, which has a dual-core ARM-Cortex-A9 hard
core that is resident on the Xilinx Zynq chip using Xilinx’s brand new
“Vivado Design Suite” along with their “Software Development Kit”
(SDK).
