# Private Timer

## Introduction
This lab guides you through the process of writing a software application that utilizes the private timer of the CPU. You will refer to the timerâ€™s API in the SDK to create and debug the software application. The application you will develop will monitor the dip switch values and increment a count on the LEDs. The application will exit when the center push button is pressed.


## Procedure
This lab comprises 4 primary steps: Open the project in Vivado, create a SDK software project, verify operation in hardware, and launch the debugger and debug the design.
